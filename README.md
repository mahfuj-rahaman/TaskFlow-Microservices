## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is microservices architecture?

**Microservices architecture** is a software design pattern where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over networks. Each service:
- Runs in its own process
- Can be deployed independently
- Owns its own database
- Communicates via lightweight protocols (HTTP, gRPC, messaging)
- Can be developed using different technologies

**This repository demonstrates:** Complete microservices implementation with 6+ services, inter-service communication patterns, distributed data management, and production deployment strategies.

### Why use ASP.NET Core for microservices?

**ASP.NET Core** is ideal for microservices because it offers:
- **High Performance**: One of the fastest web frameworks (TechEmpower benchmarks)
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Built-in DI**: Dependency injection out of the box
- **gRPC Support**: Native support for high-performance RPC
- **Minimal APIs**: Lightweight endpoint creation
- **Cloud-Ready**: Optimized for containers and Kubernetes

**This project shows:** Real-world ASP.NET Core microservices with REST APIs, gRPC services, background workers, and Blazor frontends.

### What is Clean Architecture?

**Clean Architecture** (also called Onion Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture) is a software design pattern that separates code into layers based on business logic proximity:
