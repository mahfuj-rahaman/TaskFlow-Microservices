# 🤖 AI-Powered Feature Scaffolding Guide

## Overview

The TaskFlow AI-Powered Feature Scaffolding System helps you rapidly generate complete microservice features from business requirements using AI assistance.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Traditional Approach:**
1. You write a domain entity manually
2. Run a script to generate boilerplate
3. Fill in TODOs everywhere
4. No documentation or requirements

**AI-Powered Approach:**
1. You describe what you want (e.g., "Identity management")
2. AI creates a complete specification document
3. AI asks you questions to refine requirements
4. AI generates ALL code - Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API, Tests
5. Everything is documented and ready to use

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Run the AI Scaffolding Script

```bash
cd /path/to/TaskFlow-Microservices/main
./scripts/ai-scaffold.sh <FeatureName> <ServiceName>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/ai-scaffold.sh Identity User
```

### Step 2: Answer AI Questions

The script will ask you:

1. **Purpose**: What is the main purpose of this feature?
   - Example: "Manage user authentication and identity"

2. **Properties**: What properties should the entity have?
   - Format: `PropertyName:Type:Required`
   - Example: `Email:string:true`
   - Example: `IsVerified:bool:true`

3. **Business Rules**: What are the key business rules?
   - Example: "Email must be unique"
   - Example: "Password must be at least 8 characters"

4. **Additional Operations**: What operations beyond CRUD are needed?
   - Example: "VerifyEmail"
   - Example: "ResetPassword"

### Step 3: Review the Generated Specification

The AI creates `docs/features/{FeatureName}_feature.md` containing:
- ✅ Complete business requirements
- ✅ Domain model definition
- ✅ API endpoints specification
- ✅ Database schema
- ✅ Security requirements
- ✅ Testing strategy
- ✅ Implementation checklist

### Step 4: Generate Code (Coming Soon)

```bash
./scripts/generate-from-spec.sh Identity User
```

This will generate:
- ✅ Domain Layer (Entity, Events, Exceptions)
- ✅ Application Layer (DTOs, Commands, Queries, Handlers, Validators)
- ✅ Infrastructure Layer (Repository, EF Configuration)
- ✅ API Layer (Controllers, Swagger docs)
- ✅ Tests (Unit tests, Integration tests)

ℹ Feature: Identity
ℹ Service: User
ℹ Feature Document: docs/features/Identity_feature.md

▶ Step 1: Creating Feature Specification Document
✓ Feature specification created: docs/features/Identity_feature.md

▶ Step 2: Review Feature Specification
[Shows the full specification document]

▶ Step 3: Gather Requirements

1. What is the main purpose of the Identity feature?
   Answer: Manage user authentication with email and password

2. What properties should the IdentityEntity have?
   Format: PropertyName:Type:Required (one per line, empty line to finish)
   Example: Email:string:true
   Property: Email:string:true
   Property: PasswordHash:string:true
   Property: IsEmailVerified:bool:true
   Property: LastLoginAt:DateTime:false
   Property:

3. What are the key business rules?
   (one per line, empty line to finish)
   Rule: Email must be unique
   Rule: Password must be at least 8 characters
   Rule: Account locks after 5 failed attempts
   Rule:

4. What additional operations beyond CRUD are needed?
   Example: ActivateUser, DeactivateUser, ResetPassword
   (one per line, empty line to finish)
   Operation: VerifyEmail
   Operation: ResetPassword
   Operation: ChangePassword
   Operation:

▶ Step 4: Updating Feature Specification
ℹ Properties recorded: 4 properties
ℹ Business rules recorded: 3 rules
ℹ Additional operations recorded: 3 operations
✓ Feature specification updated

▶ Step 5: Ready to Generate Code

ℹ Feature specification is ready at: docs/features/Identity_feature.md

⚠ Next step: Generate code from specification
